//! Optimal color computations for colorimetry observers.
//!
//! This module provides functionality to compute the theoretical gamut boundary
//! (optimal colors) for a given observer and illuminant. It defines the
//! [`OptimalColors`] struct, which stores a matrix of XYZ tristimulus values
//! derived from optimal spectra, as well as methods for generating and working
//! with these values.
//!
//! The optimal color computations are based on the observerâ€™s color matching
//! functions and a specified reference white, and are useful for visualizing
//! the limits of color spaces under different viewing conditions.

/// Represents the set of optimal colors in colorimetry.
///
/// Optimal colors define the theoretical limits of color saturation (chroma) for given
/// lightness and hue values. They are based on binary reflectance spectra that reflect
/// either 0% or 100% of light at each wavelength, representing the most vivid colors
/// physically possible under the constraints of human vision.
///
/// These colors form the boundary of the CIE color spaces (such as CIE 1931 or CIELAB),
/// and are used to compute:
///
/// - The spectral locus in chromaticity diagrams.
/// - The maximum chroma values at given lightness and hue levels in perceptual spaces like CIELAB.
///
/// Although optimal colors do not correspond to real-world pigments or displays, they are
/// essential for defining the theoretical gamut of visible colors.

    /// Computes the optimal colors for the observer under the specified reference white.
    ///
    /// The resulting `OptimalColors` contains a matrix of tristimulus values
    /// derived from optimal spectra.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    /// * `ref_white` - The reference white illuminant to use for the calculations.
    ///
    /// # Returns
    /// * `OptimalColors` - A struct containing the reference white and the matrix of optimal colors.
    ///
    /// # Notes
    /// * The optimal colors are computed by applying a rectangular filter to the spectral locus,
    ///   simulating the addition of contiguous spectral bands with increasing width.
    /// * Each row in the resulting matrix corresponds to a different filter width,
    ///   and the filter wraps around the spectrum to ensure continuity and to represent the full range of possible colors.
    /// * The number of spectral samples, `NS`, is fixed at 401 throughout the library.
    ///   - The resulting matrix has shape `(NS-1, NS)` = (400, 401).
    ///   - Each column corresponds to a starting wavelength, and each row to a filter width.
    /// * This is a theoretical construct and may not correspond to physically realizable colors.
    /// * As it calculates about 160,000 colors, it may be computationally intensive.
