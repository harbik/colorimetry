///     A data structure to define Standard Observers, such as the CIE 1931 2ยบ and
///     the CIE 2015 standard observers.
///
///     These are defined in the form of the three color matching functions,
///     typically denoted by $\hat{x}(\lamda)$,$\hat{y}{\lambda}$, and $\hat{z}(\lambda)$.
///     Traditionally, the CIE1931 Colorimetric Standard Observer is used almost exclusively,
///     but is known to be not a good representation of human vision in the blue region of the
///     spectrum. We also know now that the way you see color varies with age, and your healty,
///     and that not everyone sees to same color.
///
///     In this library colors are represented by spectral distributions, to allow color modelling
///     with newer, and better standard observers, such as the CIE2015 Observer, derived from
///     the sensitivities of the cones in the retina of your eye, the biological color receptors
///     of light.
///
///     It's main purpose is to calculate `XYZ` tristimulus values for a general stimulus,
///     in from of a `Spectrum`.
